# AR-Racer
This is an Augmented reality racing game built for the IOS platform. It uses Apple's AIkit and Scenekit. Note this is a one-time demo/showcase, meaning the UI may not work across all devices.
It was tested on an iPhone 13 pro.

# Features:
- Fully customizable track layout
- An AI player
- It's Augmented Reality!

# Demonstration:
Note the car crashing around is me testing it, and the other one is the AI player

The final project was going to have arcade mode where cars would fight each other, but time constraints exist.
