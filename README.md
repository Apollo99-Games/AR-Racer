# AR-Racer
This is an Augmented reality racing game built for the IOS platform. It uses Apple's ARKit and SceneKit. Note this is a one-time demo/showcase, meaning the UI may not work across all devices.
It was tested on an iPhone 13 pro.

The car model is not included in the file but can be downloaded from [BlenderKit](https://www.blenderkit.com/asset-gallery?query=category_subtree:luxury-supercar+Model:+McLaren%20720S%20(2017)+order:_score). You may have to decrease the poly count as it is a bit high.

# Features:
- Fully customizable track layout
- Detects if the track makes a complete loop
- An AI player that works on every track configuration possible
- It's Augmented Reality!

# Demonstration:
Note the car crashing around is me testing it, and the other one is the AI player.

The final project was going to have arcade mode where cars would fight each other, but time constraints exist.
Here, the black car shoots the blue and orange one with lasers. The orange one survives as it was able to activate its shields.
